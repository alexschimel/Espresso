%FUNCTION_NAME  One-line description of what the function performs
%
%   Optional multiple lines of information giving more details about the
%   function. The first line above (so-called H1 line) has no space before
%   the function name and two spaces after. FUNCTION_NAME is written in
%   upper-case throughout this docstring. One or multiple examples syntaxes
%   follow. The docstring is completed by a "See also" section that allows
%   help functions such as "help" or "doc" to automatically create
%   hyperlinks. Separated from the docstring by a single empty line are the
%   author(s) and information on last versions.
%
%   [X,Y] = FUNCTION_NAME(A,B,C) returns the sum of A+B as X, and C as Y.
%
%   X = FUNCTION_NAME(A,B) returns the sum of A+B as X, since the
%   additional input and outputs in this example are unecessary.
%
%   X = FUNCTION_NAME(A) returns A
